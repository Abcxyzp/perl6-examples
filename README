Perl6 Examples
==============

This is intended to be a repository for all kinds of perl 6 examples.

All examples should work for any implementation of perl.

If an example needs an implementation specific version then it should end in .implementation.  So for example if you are making an example that only works on rakudo then it should end in .rakudo.



Goals
-----
1. Compile a list of open source perl 6 examples
2. Help different implementations of perl 6 test out there code in a less testy and more fun manner ;)


Directories
-----------

Games - Games should go in here :)
Euler - Answers for Project Euler should go in here name them prob00-author.pl
