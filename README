Perl6 Examples
==============

This is intended to be a repository for all kinds of perl 6 examples.

All examples should work for any implementation of perl.

If an example needs an implementation specific version then it should end in .implementation.  So for example if you are making an example that only works on rakudo then it should end in .rakudo.

Why
---
Why not just use the Pugs repo?
1. This is an open repo so there is no need to obtain a commit bit (hopefully making it easier for everyone to participate)
2. This is not tied in any way to any implementation of Perl 6
3. Something NEW and FRESH is always more fun (I hope!)


Goals
-----
1. Compile a list of open source perl 6 examples
2. Help different implementations of perl 6 test out there code in a less testy and more fun manner ;)
